This is the setassociative package. This package provides functionality to create
and use N-way set associative caches.

This package is written in Python 3.6.3. It can be installed using pip
and used by importing it in Python client code.

Install from this directory
::

    pip install .

When this package is installed you can write code!
I have used Sphinx autodoc for Python to generate docs.
I have also written a usage tutorial in the same page for easy use of this package
